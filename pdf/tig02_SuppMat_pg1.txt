Explanation of Variables in Table	
Reference	"For published studies, see Literature Cited for full citation.  For unpublished loci, name of individual(s) who provided data and information about sampling design details.  For some published data, authors provided additional information, as noted. "
Locus	Name of locus as listed in paper.
Technology	Technology used for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Sampling	Study is classified as: population if at least 10 individuals were sampled from each of at most 3 populations; worldwide if at most 10 individuals were sampled from each of at least 3 populations; U.S. if didn’t fit either criteria and individuals resided in U.S.  All others are marked as unclassifiable.
nethn	"The number of ethnicities, following labels ascribed by the authors to the individuals in the sample."
prAfr	The proportion of individuals in the sample that are African or African-American.
sex	Whether the loci  is X-linked or autosomal.
genic	Whether the loci  lies in a genic region.
D value	Reported value of Tajima’s D for all individuals and all basepairs included in study.
nchrom	Number of chromosomes examined.
S	Number of segregating sites for all individuals and all basepairs.  Not available for some unpublished loci.
#bps	Number of basepairs examined. Not available for some unpublished loci.
indels?	"Whether indels were included as segregating sites, along with single nucleotide polymorphisms.  This information was not always indicated in published paper (left blank in table)."
#indels	"If S included indels, the number of indels."
reason for exclusion	The reason why this loci was excluded from our analyses:  Redundant if more than one researcher examined this loci; S < 5 if the locus was not minimally informative; and Missing D if an overall D was not reported (or provided) for all individuals and all basepairs.
comments	Additional comments about the study.
